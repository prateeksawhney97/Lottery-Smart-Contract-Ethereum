# Lottery-Smart-Contract-Ethereum

Ethereum Smart Contract that Models a Lottery.

# How it works:

To take part in the lottery every user needs to send some amount of money(which cannot be less than 0.01 ETH for each user). After some people have entered the contract a "third-party"(manager of the contract) will tell the contract to pick a winner, beware that he does not pick the winner itself, the contract does that.
After it picks the winner, the contract sends him the full price and resets; to continue for other players that want to play.
